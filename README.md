2. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice

## Usage

Follow these steps to activate Driver Booster:

### Step 1: Configure the Script Path

1. Open `script.bat` in a text editor
2. Verify that the path to your Driver Booster installation matches the path specified in the script
3. If the path is incorrect, update it to match your installation directory
4. Save the changes

### Step 2: Disable Windows Security

2. Navigate to **Virus & Threat Protection**
3. Turn off the following security features:
   - Real-time Protection
   - Cloud-delivered Protection

2. Select **"Run as administrator"**
3. Choose option 1 for activation & press Enter.
4. Wait for the script to complete. Enjoy!

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security Warning**: This script requires disabling Windows security features temporarily. Remember to re-enable them after activation.

⚠️ **Administrative Rights**: The script must be run with administrator privileges to function correctly.

⚠️ **Path Configuration**: Incorrect path configuration will prevent the script from working. Ensure the Driver Booster installation path is correct.

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Run

If the script fails to run:

1. Verify the Driver Booster installation path is correct
2. Ensure you're running the script as administrator
3. Check that all Windows security features are disabled
4. Make sure the script file is not blocked by Windows

### Driver Booster Resets to Free Version After Restart

If Driver Booster returns to the free version after a Windows restart and you need to run the script again every time before opening the program to make it Pro again, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Security settings (Press `Ctrl + I`)
2. Navigate to **Virus & Threat Protection**
3. Click on **Protection History**
4. Find the warning related to the `version.dll` file in the driver booster folder
5. Remove and then restore the warning/threat from the protection history
6. Restart your computer

This will fix the issue of Driver Booster resetting to the free version from Pro, and you won't need to run the activation script before every use.
